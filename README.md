# Simple Lunrjs Display

This is a demo how to easily display [lunrjs](https://lunrjs.com/) index using javascript and generic styling using [pico css](https://picocss.com/)

It's feature in a tutorial article [Creating Search Engine for any Website using Web Scraping](https://scrapfly.io/blog/search-engine-using-web-scraping/) so take a look at that for full instructions on how to use this.

To modify this with your data just replace `search_index.json` file with your own lunrjs index. This demo expects documents to be composed of fields `title` and `text`
